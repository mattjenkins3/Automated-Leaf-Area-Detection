# A versatile tool to rapidly process and analyze leaf photos

Leaf area is an important morphological metric than can be useful for comparing plants, understanding their growth over time and for calculating things like ET. While measuring leaf area is a rather straightforward
process, it is also hands on, time-consuming and error prone using modern techniques. To address this issue we have developed an image processing pipeline that allows researchers to take photos of all leaves for which an area is needed, then automatically calculate an accurate leaf area for all leaves.

__Input:__ Photo(s) of any leaf on reference paper, with (optional) bubble annotation; no limit to number of photos

__Output:__ Data table containing ID info for each leaf and leaf area
