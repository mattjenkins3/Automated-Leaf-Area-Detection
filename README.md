## This branch is dedicated to development of the bubble sheet feature
This feature allows users to fill out a bubble sheet before taking photos, allowing for enhanced automated image annotation.

For example, a four row, five option, bubble sheet can be included and users can describe the position of the harvested leaf using four parameters (e.g. height, orientation, or genotype), with five categorical options for each parameter.
